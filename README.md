# Hierarchial Discontinuous Galerkin (DGPn) Code for advection of Level-Set.
- Academic code.
- Uses Legendre polynomials as Basis functions.
- Written in a hierarchial format. Therefore can go to any arbitrary order of accuracy.
- 2D structured grids.
- Time integration: Explicit multi-stage Runge-Kutta.
- Parallelized using MPI libraries utilizing a domain decomposition strategy.

## Code progress
- DGPn implementation of Level-set advection is complete.
